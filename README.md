# MovieDB

Basic java application that allows users to inventory and view Movie information through CLI. Very rough around the edges project from an intro to OOP Course years ago.

Supports Movie titles, actors, ratings, release years, and other basic information that can be added/updated/removed by Admin. Has a Like/Comment system for users.
